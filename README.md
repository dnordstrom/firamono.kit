# Embedded WOFF Kit

## Fira Mono by Mozilla

Fira Mono (which complements [Fira Sans](https://github.com/dnordstrom/kit.firasans) beautifully) is embedded into the CSS file using data-uri's, for silky smooth inclusion into your projects. The kit contains the available weights: regular and bold.

To use the font, simply include the CSS file on your page (or copy the contents into your own stylesheet). The `font-family` is always `'Fira Mono'`.

For production use, I recommend removing weights you don't use to reduce the size.
